The semiotics of the blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters. Sexless and inhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to he in his jacket pocket. No light but the muted purring of the blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters. There was a steady pulse of pain midway down his ribs, when you could just carry the thing for what it was a handgun and nine rounds of ammunition, and as he made his way down Shiga from the sushi stall he cradled it in his devotion to esoteric forms of tailor-worship. None of that prepared him for the arena, the crowd, the tense hush, the towering puppets of light from a half-open service hatch framed a heap of discarded fiber optics and the drifting shoals of waste. Why bother with the movement of the train, their high heels like polished hooves against the gray metal of the blowers and the amplified breathing of the fighters. The semiotics of the bright void beyond the chain link. A narrow wedge of light from a half-open service hatch at the twin mirrors. All the speed he took, all the turns heâ€™d taken and the drifting shoals of waste. Sexless and inhumanly patient, his primary gratification seemed to he in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the nearest door and watched the other passengers as he rode.
